# Market-Basket-Analysis-for-E-Commerce-Apriori-Algorithm
In this project, we delve into Market Basket Analysis using the Apriori algorithm to uncover hidden patterns within the sales data of a UK-based online retail store.With the aim of suggesting relevant product offers to customers at the basket stage, we follow a structured approach encompassing data preprocessing, association rule determination, and practical recommendations for effective marketing strategies. By leveraging transactional data spanning from December 2009 to December 2011, our analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior and optimizing product recommendations for enhanced customer engagement and revenue generation.
